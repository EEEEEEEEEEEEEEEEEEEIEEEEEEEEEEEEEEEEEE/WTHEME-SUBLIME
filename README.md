# WTHEME-SUBLIME

My color configuration for Sublime text editor. Modded for .sh syntaxes only

Colorscheme is from myself but the theme in use is Asphalt-monochrome.subltime-theme, install this theme via package control

     # For syntax colors:
     Download the wuseman.tmTheme file
     copy the tmTheme file into: ~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/User/
     You will now be able to use my color scheme by press Preferences/ColorScheme in toolbar
     That's it!

     # For theme:
     Press ctrl+shift
     Install Package Control
     Hit ctrl+shift again
     Search for install and choose Package Control: Install Package
     Now search for the asphalt theme or simply just use default and use my colorscheme.
