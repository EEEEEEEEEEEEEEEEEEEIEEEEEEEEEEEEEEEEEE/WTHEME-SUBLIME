# SUBLIME 

My color configuration for Sublime text editor. Modded for .sh syntaxes only

Colorscheme is from myself but the theme in use is Asphalt-monochrome.subltime-theme, install this theme via package control

     Press ctrl+shift
     Install Package Control
     Hit ctrl+shift again
     Search for install and choose Package Control: Install Package
     Now search for the asphalt theme or simply just use default and use my colorscheme.
